# AVID: GPU-enabled Visual Analytics with GPU-FAST-PROCLUS
## Linux
For running on linux, we have created a makefile.
Simply run:
<pre>make release</pre>

## Windows
For running on windows, we have created a visual studio project.

## Run
To run the visualization tool in the terminal, run:
<pre>./bin/release/main data/X1_000_000_D8.csv</pre>
You can of course run the tool with any dataset you want, as long as the format is a comma seperated csv-file with floating point value.
